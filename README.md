# DeployMachineLearningModel
End-to-End Machine Learning Model Development with Python, Git, Flask, and Automated Training Pipeline

# ML Pipeline Workflow
1. Data Ingestion: Collects raw data from various sources and loads it into the pipeline.
2. Data Validation: Checks data quality and consistency, identifying and handling any issues.
3. Data Transformation: Converts data into a suitable format, including necessary adjustments for model compatibility.
4. Model Training: Trains a machine learning model on the prepared data to learn patterns and make predictions.
5. Model Evaluation: Assesses model performance using metrics to ensure it meets desired criteria and is ready for deployment.
